# Norway-Automotive-Sales-Overview
Data Analysis Project using Power BI

Built an interactive dashboard analyzing sales trends, revenue performance, and fuel-type demand using Power BI and DAX.

KEY FEATURES:

1. Business Problem:
The business needed a clear and simple way to understand car sales performance in Norway. The raw data was available, but it was difficult to identify sales trends, top brands, popular models, and customer fuel preferences from tables alone.

2. Goal of the Dashboard:
The goal was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that gives a quick overview of sales, revenue, and demand, while allowing users to easily analyze performance by year, brand, model, and fuel type to support better decision-making.

3. Key Visuals:
The dashboard starts with KPI cards showing unique models, units sold, total revenue, and average price. A line chart displays annual quantity trends to understand growth over time. Bar charts compare total sales and quantity by brand, while a fuel type chart shows customer preferences. A Top 5 models by revenue visual highlights the best-performing products. Logo-based slicers and a collapsible filter panel make the dashboard easy and interactive to use.

4. Key Insights:
a. Sales Trend Over Time:
Car sales show a clear year-wise trend, helping us understand whether the market is growing, stable, or declining.            Certain years perform better than others, indicating changes in customer demand and market conditions.
Insight: The market does not grow evenly every year, which highlights the need for timely planning and forecasting.

b. Brand Performance
Some brands consistently sell more vehicles and generate higher revenue than others. A small number of brands contribute a large share of total sales, while others have lower demand.
Insight: Sales are concentrated among top-performing brands, which are key revenue drivers for the business.

c. Model Contribution
Only a few models generate maximum revenue, even though many models exist. These top models are strong performers due to high demand, higher pricing, or both.
Insight: Focusing on high-revenue models can significantly impact overall business performance.

d. ️Fuel Type Preference
Customers show a clear preference for certain fuel types. Some fuel categories dominate total sales, while others have relatively lower demand.
Insight: Fuel preference data helps businesses align inventory with customer demand and sustainability goals.

e.  Quantity vs Revenue Behavior
High sales volume does not always mean high revenue. Some brands or models sell in large quantities at lower prices, while others sell fewer units at higher prices.
Insight: Both volume and pricing need to be analyzed together to understand true performance.



6. Business Impact:
This dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions related to pricing, inventory planning, product focus, and sales strategy. It saves time, improves visibility into performance, and turns raw data into actionable business insights.

-> Future Plan:
1. Using historical year-wise sales trends, the business can predict future demand more accurately. This helps plan production, inventory, and sales targets in advance.
2. Invest more in popular fuel types
3. Increase marketing for top models
4. Increase prices for high-demand models
5. Offer discounts for low-performing models
